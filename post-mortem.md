**Actual schedule:**

  1. Visualization: 9:00 - 12:00
  1. Data transformation: 13:00 - 15:35
  1. Markdown: 15:45 - 16:30 (we must cut it to half and make it more funny)
  1. Joins: 9:00 - 10:00
  1. Types: 10:00 - 12:30
  1. Tidy data: 13:30 - 14:15
  1. Lists: 14:25 - 16:00 (we must cut it to half and make it more funny)
  
**Suggested cuts in the content**:

  1. Visualization: slides 89-116 (parameters, grammar of graphics) - to be removed
  1. Data transformation: slides 128-145 (alternative popularity definition) - just walk them through 
  1. Markdown: needs to be rewritten from scratch 
  1. Joins: slides 31-36 (semi-join, anti-join) - to be removed
  1. Types: slides 71-81 (similar reordering functions, changing levels) - to be removed, 93-130 (times and dates) just walk them through
  1. Tidy data: slides 67-97 (everything excepth gather and spread) - to be removed
  1. Lists: slide 54-end to be removed (keep just lists and intro to map)
  
**Other issues:**

  1. Data transformation: "03-Transform" instead of "O2-Data-Transform" (e.g. slide 13)
  1. Tidy data: several slides have problem with formatting (most likely some conversion issues, e.g. slide 103)
