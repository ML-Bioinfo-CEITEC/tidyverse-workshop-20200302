**Actual schedule:**

  1. Visualization: 9:00 - 12:00
  1. Data transformation: 13:00 - 15:35
  1. Markdown: 15:45 - 16:30 (we must cut it to half and make it more funny)
  1. Joins: 9:00 - 10:00
  1. Types: 10:00 - 12:30
  1. Tidy data: 13:30 - 14:15
  1. Lists: 14:25 - 16:00 (we must cut it to half and make it more funny)
  
**Suggested cuts in the content**:

  1. Visualization: slides 89-116 (parameters, grammar of graphics) - to be removed
  1. Data transformation: slides 128-145 (alternative popularity definition) - just walk them through 
  1. Markdown: needs to be rewritten from scratch 
  1. Joins: slides 31-36 (semi-join, anti-join) - to be removed
  1. Types: slides 71-81 (similar reordering functions, changing levels) - to be removed, 93-130 (times and dates) just walk them through
  1. Tidy data: slides 67-97 (everything excepth gather and spread) - to be removed
  1. Lists: slide 54-end to be removed (keep just lists and intro to map)
  
**Other issues:**

  1. Data transformation: "03-Transform" instead of "O2-Data-Transform" (e.g. slide 13)
  1. Tidy data: several slides have problem with formatting (most likely some conversion issues, e.g. slide 103)
  
**Check-list before the next workshop:**

  1. Power extension cords & WiFi access for participants
  1. Red and green sticky notes
  1. [Printed cheat-sheets](https://github.com/ML-Bioinfo-CEITEC/tidyverse-workshop-20200302/tree/master/RStudio_cheatsheets)
  1. Intro slides (you need to change date and place, also names of instructors), practice the presentation
  1. Check Logistics on [this page](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2019/09/remaster-tidyverse/), do not forget to email participants with details and install instructions
