Thank you for enrolling in our workshop, Master the Tidyverse. 

To prepare for the workshop, please, bring a laptop to class that has the following installed:

* A recent version of R (>=3.5.0), which is available for free at [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* A recent version of RStudio Desktop (>=1.1.456), available for free at www.rstudio.com/download (RStudio Desktop Open Source License)
* The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running at the command line:

```
install.packages(c("babynames", "nycflights13", "mgcv", "repurrrsive", "rmarkdown", "tidyverse", "flexdashboard"))
```

And don't forget your power cord!

If possible, also, please, sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/. The RStudio Cloud will be used as a backup if there will be anything wrong with your installation. 

If you have never seen R before, I recommend familiarize yourself with the environment before the course. There are many free courses and materials all over the internet that can help you ([Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics), [EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-r-for-data-science-2), [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651), [Software Carpentery](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)).

We look forward to meeting you,

Petr and Andrea
